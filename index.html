"One of my oldest songs, I was heavily inspired by Touhou 5's title screen song. To this day I find this one a classic due to the converging melodies that go together surprisingly nicely. \n I have probably remixed this song too many times to count, for a while this would be my go-to song if someone was to ask me what kind of music I make.",
"Although my actual first song was Kevin64, this is technically the first proper song I ever made that wasn't just me fiddling with LMMS. This was my first attempt to make a song in the style of the old PC98 Touhou games. What really strikes me is that many remixes exist of this particular song, which I struggled to make the melody for.",
"The Femvin theme song. This song embodies all the adventures and recreations of the stories I had been trying to make since I was young. \n Many of the melodies of this song were derived off the failed song named 'Boop Ensuite', following that mistake, I focused really heavily in trying to make this song really simple with recurring melodies that would mutate. \n I tweaked the song a bit over time to mutate the melodies further as the song went on.",
"My first proper attempt at vaporwave. I had previously learnt to pitch blend with synth chords and utilised the atmospheric sounds that I could get out of certain instruments. This is definitely a more minimalist track as compared to the style of melodies I'm typically known for making.",
"One of my favourite beats, this track was a massive mutation of another song, where I took two components and decided to try and make an atmospheric piece out of it. The moment I realised how good the panning synth that repeats across the whole song sounds, it felt natural to continue. ",
"A hip hop inspired song, I found myself listening to this song for hours as I was making it. Very likely the most hypnotic song I've ever made in my opinion. This is one of those tracks where I can't particularly pick a favourite component, it was a joy to continously add new components to this one.",
"Following some advice from a friend to make more simple, memorable melodies, I decided to do just that and make a song that was focused much more on the drum programming. This is one of the most memorable songs I ever worked on.",
"I was very inspired to try and make a song inspired by elements of New Jack Swing and Rap Rock, but with the twist that the instrumentation is still very heavily coded in my style. I was still very new to using drum breaks, so the use of one on this song was a massive indicator to me that I could continue with the sound I desired. I had tried years ago to get a very heavy sound similar to what was achieved here, but I suppose I needed more experience before tackling something that difficult.",
"After practicing some more with drum breaks, I decided to jump straight into making a song inspired from my childhood vision of a very overly energetic and emotional sounding EDM boss fight song, only this time influenced more by breakcore."
